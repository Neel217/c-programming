Subarray is a continuous part of the array.
-> number of subarray = nC2 + n = n(n+1)/2

A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from an array by selecting zero
or more elements, without changing the order of the remaining elements.
-> Number of subsequences of an array with n elements = 2^n

subarray is subset of subsequence
